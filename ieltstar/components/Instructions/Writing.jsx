      <h1>Test Format â€“ Writing (30 minutes)</h1>
      <h5>
        The Writing component includes two tasks that are based on topics of
        general interest.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Task 1</b> <br />
        You will be presented with a situation and asked to write a letter
        requesting information or explaining the situation. The letter may be
        personal, semi-formal or formal in style.
        <br /> <br />
        <b>Task 2</b> <br />
        You will be asked to write an essay in response to a point of view,
        argument or problem. The essay can be slightly more personal in style
        than the Academic Writing Task 2 essay.
